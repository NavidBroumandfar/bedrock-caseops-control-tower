## How to Start a Session

At the beginning of any major implementation session, read these four files in order before making changes:

1. `README.md` — understand the public-facing purpose and constraints
2. `PROJECT_SPEC.md` — confirm scope, requirements, and what phase you are in
3. `ARCHITECTURE.md` — confirm the technical design before touching any code
4. `docs/CURSOR_CONTEXT.md` (this file) — orient quickly on current state

If there is any conflict between files, `PROJECT_SPEC.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` take precedence over this file.

---

## Project Purpose

Build an AWS-native multi-agent pipeline that processes technical and operational documents (FDA letters, CISA advisories, incident reports), retrieves grounded evidence from a Bedrock Knowledge Base, classifies severity/category, recommends actions, validates outputs, and flags escalations. Outputs are structured JSON with full citations.

This is a GitHub portfolio project. It should feel production-style but remain narrow and finishable as an MVP.

---

## Locked AWS Stack

| Service | Role |
|---|---|
| Amazon S3 | Document storage and output archiving |
| Amazon Bedrock | Foundation model inference (Converse API) |
| Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases | Managed vector store and retrieval |
| Amazon Bedrock Agents | Agent orchestration and tool use |
| AWS Lambda | Serverless execution |
| Amazon CloudWatch | Logging and observability |

Do not add other AWS services without explicit discussion.

---

## Baseline Agent Architecture (locked)

1. **Supervisor / Planner Agent** — orchestrates pipeline, routes exceptions
2. **Retrieval Agent** — queries Bedrock KB, returns evidence chunks + citations
3. **Analysis Agent** — classifies severity/category, summarizes, recommends (evidence-only)
4. **Validation / Critic Agent** — audits analysis for unsupported claims, assigns confidence score
5. **Tool Executor Agent** — formats CaseOutput, applies escalation logic, archives to S3

- Bedrock KB retrieval with citations
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Structured JSON output (CaseOutput schema)
- Severity classification and escalation logic

- Bedrock Guardrails (planned v2)
- Bedrock Evaluations (planned v2)
- Prompt caching / routing (planned v2)
- Bedrock Flows (planned v3)

## Architecture Constraints

These are design contracts followed across all implementation work. They apply to all phases and must not be violated when extending the system.

- Agents are Python classes with a `run()` method that accepts and returns typed Pydantic models
- Agents do not call AWS clients directly — they call service methods from `app/services/`
- Service modules are thin wrappers; they do not contain business logic
- All structured outputs conform to the `CaseOutput` schema defined in `app/schemas/`
- Citations are first-class: never dropped, never fabricated
- Escalation threshold is config-driven (set in `.env`, read from config)
- All logs are structured JSON with `session_id`, `document_id`, `agent`, `event` fields
- No inline code comments that only describe what the code does; comments explain intent

---

## Current Implementation Phase

**Phase 1 — v1 MVP COMPLETE | Phase F — Evaluation Foundation COMPLETE | Phase G — Retrieval & Output Quality COMPLETE**

> **Live Bedrock validation is pending:** Live AWS Knowledge Base sync is currently blocked by AWS-side Titan Text Embeddings V2 throttling/runtime issues in the target account. All code is implemented correctly; all 1156 unit and evaluation tests pass without live AWS calls. This is an external AWS-side blocker, not a code issue. The Phase F, G-0, G-1, and G-2 evaluation layers are fully independent of this blocker.

The repository is portfolio-ready, test-complete, and demo-friendly for the full MVP and Phase F evaluation scope.

  - `app/evaluation/retrieval_scorer.py` — three deterministic offline metrics: `minimum_chunks_match`, `source_label_hit_rate`, `required_evidence_term_coverage`; `RetrievalScoringResult` (frozen dataclass); `score_retrieval()` public API
  - `app/evaluation/loader.py` — extended with `load_retrieval_expectations()` to extract `_retrieval_expectation` blocks from F-1 expected fixtures
  - `tests/fixtures/retrieval_outputs/` — 5 candidate retrieval fixtures: `strong_retrieval.json`, `weak_retrieval.json`, `missing_source_labels.json`, `missing_evidence_terms.json`, `empty_retrieval.json`
  - `tests/test_retrieval_scorer.py` — 55 tests covering all three metrics, pass/fail logic, fixture loading, dataset alignment, not-applicable policy, and deterministic repeated-run behavior

  - `app/evaluation/output_quality_scorer.py` — composite scorer: calls F-2 `score_case()` and G-1 `score_citations()`, adds `summary_nonempty`, `recommendations_present_when_expected`, `unsupported_claims_clean` checks; overall score = mean of five components; hard gates on summary_nonempty and unsupported_claims_clean; does NOT import retrieval_scorer (G-0)
  - `tests/fixtures/output_quality_outputs/` — 5 targeted fixtures: `strong_output.json`, `blank_summary.json`, `missing_recommendations.json`, `unsupported_claims_present.json`, `good_core_weak_citations.json`

### Next step
- **Phase H** — Safety & Guardrails; see `PROJECT_SPEC.md §13`

### Phase 2 roadmap

Phase 2 follows the same lettered-subphase naming convention as Phase 1 (A–E):

| Phase | Theme | Status | Subphases |
|---|---|---|---|
| **F** | Evaluation Foundation | ✅ Complete | F-0 evaluation contracts + schemas, F-1 reference dataset, F-2 scoring runner |
| **G** | Retrieval & Output Quality | ✅ Complete | G-0 retrieval metrics ✅, G-1 citation quality ✅, G-2 output scoring ✅ |
| **H** | Safety & Guardrails | Not started | H-0 safety contracts, H-1 Bedrock Guardrails integration, H-2 adversarial suite |
| **I** | Optimization | Not started | I-0 prompt caching, I-1 prompt routing, I-2 baseline vs optimized comparison |
| **J** | Observability & Reporting | Not started | J-0 CloudWatch dashboard, J-1 result artifacts, J-2 v2 hardening checkpoint |

See `PROJECT_SPEC.md §13` for the full Phase 2 subphase breakdown.

### Not yet implemented
- Live Bedrock validation (blocked by AWS-side throttling — not a code issue)
- Phase H–J: safety guardrails, prompt optimization, CloudWatch reporting

Reference: `ARCHITECTURE.md §5–9` for component flows. `PROJECT_SPEC.md §13` for the full subphase roadmap.
